# generate-message-tool
Generate `message` from `UnsignedTx.json`.
For securely signing CKB transactions we provide a tool to generate message,so you can double confirm it with the message generated from [felix](https://github.com/zengbing15/felix#use-generate-message-tool-to-validate-the-messages).

## How to Run

* [Run a CKB Testnet node](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/basics/guides/testnet).
* Put the JSON file `UnsignedTx.json` generated by [felix](https://github.com/zengbing15/felix) into the project.

* Install dependencies
 
 ```bash
$ npm install
``` 
* Run generate-message-tool

 ```bash
$ npm start
``` 
You can also use the generate-message-tool as command line tool.Run the npm install command as follows:

```bash
npm install -g .
```
This installs your script “globally.” Any commands listed in the bin section of the `package.json` file will be made available as command line applications. You can now run it by typing `generate-message-tool` at the command line.

To uninstall the tool, run the following command:

```bash
npm uninstall -g generate-message-tool
```

* Double confirm the `message` with the message generated by [felix](https://github.com/zengbing15/felix)

```bash
the message generated by this tool:

The generated message is 0xb4544c8eea3d7a02778d52401ea041aff1a97659d0b4a93fda3a5cc3c28aa8e8
```

```bash
the message generated by felix:
Please sign the following messages required by the transaction:

Address: ckt1qyqddquttee9zqlj7xlmtrd7vjunp2zh5f3spa2vjy
Message: 0xb4544c8eea3d7a02778d52401ea041aff1a97659d0b4a93fda3a5cc3c28aa8e8

Signatures must be in hex string format with 0x prefix, each different signature should occupy its own line.
```
